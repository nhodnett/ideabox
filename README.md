# IdeaBox

This project allows the user to title, write, and save their ideas instantly using a user-friendly interface.  Once the idea has been created and saved, the user can view their ideas in the idea card section. After that, if they so choose, they can favorite them using the star icon, or delete them using the X icon.

## Instructions For Use
- When the page loads, the user will see options for adding a title and body for their ideas, as well as a button titled <u>*Save*</u> for saving them and a search bar for filtering them according to a provided search criteria.
- If the user does not add a title or body to their idea, the save option will grey out as unavailable.
- When the user writes their idea and then hits <u>*Save*</u>, the idea will immediately appear below on a spontaneously generated idea card.  The user may generate as many idea cards as they like provided they have enough memory for them.
- If the user really likes the idea, they may activate the star icon by clicking on it in the upper left-hand corner of the idea card.
- If the user decides the idea was never really that great in the first place, they may hit the delete icon <u>*X*</u> in the upper right-hand corner of the idea card.  After that, the idea will be permanently removed from the system.

## Future Additions
- In the next release, the user will be able to filter their ideas to only show their favorited ideas by clicking the <u>*Show Starred Ideas*</u> button.
- They will also be able to use the search box for filtering their ideas based on an inputted search criteria.
- While we had functioning prototype for the previously mentioned features, we chose not to include them **in the name of professionalism** because they had some functionality bugs by the time of submission.
- Additionally, in a future release, the user will be able to add a comment by clicking the comment button <u>*+*</u>.
